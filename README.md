Installation & Configuration
============================
Kenni requires python 3.x

1. Run ./kenni - this creates a default config file
2. Edit ~/Kenni/config/default.py
3. Run ./kenni - this now runs kenni with your settings

Enjoy!

P.S: You'll encounter a number of missing dependencies upon first run. Feel free to install them via pip
